    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook evaluates which configuration-related variables have sufficient empirical support to define **within-size structural variation** in residential solar systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is **not** to analyze structure yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to determine, empirically and transparently:\n",
    "- which variables are populated,\n",
    "- over what time span,\n",
    "- and whether they can plausibly support configuration analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step satisfies the requirement to **record and report how exclusion decisions are made** before restricting the analytical space.\n"
