    "# Notebook 2 — Structural Degrees of Freedom at Fixed Size\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook evaluates **structural degrees of freedom (DoF) conditional on system size**\n",
    "for residential photovoltaic installations and defines **configuration equivalence classes**\n",
    "at fixed size.\n",
    "\n",
    "It consumes the system-level structural configuration artifact produced upstream,\n",
    "which enforces one row per `tts_link_id` and excludes sentinel identifiers prior to merge.\n",
    "All configuration families represented here correspond to realized, valid system identities.\n",
    "\n",
    "System size is treated as **fixed by analysis**, not as a configuration dimension.\n",
    "Conditioning is performed using cohort-relative size indices and size bands to ensure\n",
    "comparability across systems of similar scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objectives of this notebook are threefold:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify structural degrees of freedom at fixed size** by empirically determining\n",
    "   which architectural and functional configuration dimensions vary independently when\n",
    "   system size is held fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Derive structural constraints** by identifying dimensions that become effectively\n",
    "   fixed or degenerate within size bands, yielding a structural constraint specification\n",
    "   suitable for downstream analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Define configuration equivalence classes** by grouping systems that are structurally\n",
    "   identical at fixed size, equating them on constrained dimensions while ignoring\n",
    "   dimensions that vary freely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structural degrees of freedom are computed **at the variable level**, within size bands.\n",
    "Each variable contributes degrees of freedom according to its admissible value structure\n",
    "(binary, discrete, or ratio-based), evaluated only where that variable is structurally\n",
    "defined and physically meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook outputs the following artifacts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Structural constraints** (`structural_constraints.parquet`), encoding which\n",
    "  configuration dimensions are constrained or free at fixed size.\n",
    "- **Configuration equivalence classes** (`configuration_classes.parquet`), assigning\n",
    "  systems to structurally equivalent realizations at fixed size.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook does not infer regimes, evaluate deviation surfaces, or assign risk.\n",
    "Its role is strictly descriptive and structural, providing the dimensional and equivalence\n",
    "substrate required for downstream scaling, regime geometry, and deviation analysis.\n",

    "### Interpretation — Functional Structural Degrees of Freedom at Fixed Size\n",
    "\n",
    "This visualization reports the total number of **functional structural degrees of freedom**\n",
    "available to residential photovoltaic systems within each size band after restricting\n",
    "attention to architectural and functional dimensions only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structural degrees of freedom are tightly bounded, ranging approximately between 22 and 24\n",
    "across all size bands. This confirms that, once system size is held fixed and non-structural\n",
    "measurement artifacts are removed, residential PV systems operate within a **highly\n",
    "constrained configuration space**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no monotonic relationship between system size and total structural degrees of\n",
    "freedom. Larger systems do not exhibit systematically higher architectural freedom than\n",
    "smaller systems. This rules out the hypothesis that structural dimensionality scales\n",
    "directly with size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observed variation across size bands reflects **reallocation of structural freedom across\n",
    "dimensions**, rather than the creation or destruction of freedom in aggregate. Certain\n",
    "dimensions become constrained in some bands while others remain available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because degrees of freedom are aggregated into a single scalar, this visualization does\n",
    "not reveal which specific configuration dimensions drive these changes. Two size bands\n",
    "may exhibit identical total degrees of freedom while differing substantially in their\n",
    "internal architectural structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, total structural degrees of freedom function here as a **sanity check** rather\n",
    "than a diagnostic for regime boundaries. Determining whether structural behavior changes\n",
    "with size requires decomposing degrees of freedom **by variable** within each size band.\n"

    "### Structural Degrees of Freedom by Variable at Fixed Size\n",
    "\n",
    "Total structural degrees of freedom aggregate contributions across heterogeneous\n",
    "configuration dimensions and therefore conceal how structural freedom is allocated\n",
    "internally. To understand which architectural and functional dimensions drive variation\n",
    "at fixed size, degrees of freedom must be decomposed **by variable** within each size band.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, structural degrees of freedom are computed separately for each admissible\n",
    "configuration dimension and evaluated within size bands. This decomposition serves three\n",
    "purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify which variables contribute non-zero structural freedom at fixed size.\n",
    "2. Determine whether observed variation in total DoF reflects changes in specific\n",
    "   dimensions or offsetting effects across multiple dimensions.\n",
    "3. Provide the empirical basis for classifying configuration dimensions as constrained\n",
    "   or free prior to defining configuration equivalence classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "No inference, regime assignment, or deviation assessment is performed here. The output of\n",
    "this step is a variable-level accounting of structural degrees of freedom suitable for\n",
    "diagnosing architectural structure and informing equivalence class construction.\n"

    "### Structural Degrees of Freedom at Fixed Size: Findings and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis of structural degrees of freedom at fixed system size reveals that\n",
    "residential photovoltaic systems in California occupy a largely fixed-dimensional\n",
    "structural configuration space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across all size bands, most architectural and functional dimensions exhibit\n",
    "either invariant degrees of freedom or are fully constrained. In particular,\n",
    "binary architectural indicators (e.g., mounting context, ownership model,\n",
    "tracking presence) contribute constant degrees of freedom across size, while\n",
    "certain dimensions (e.g., microinverter presence) are structurally constrained\n",
    "and do not vary within any size band.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only a small number of dimensions, most notably module mixture count, exhibit\n",
    "limited variation across size bands. This variation is bounded and does not\n",
    "indicate the emergence of new independent structural dimensions at larger system\n",
    "sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings imply that increases in system size do not correspond to an\n",
    "expansion of the structural configuration space. Instead, larger systems occupy\n",
    "different regions within a stable, low-dimensional space. As a result, potential\n",
    "oversizing, undersizing, or elevated design risk cannot be attributed to increased\n",
    "architectural freedom, but must arise from deviations within a fixed structural\n",
    "geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Before deriving configuration equivalence classes, structural variables will be\n",
    "classified according to their empirical role at fixed size:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Structurally constrained dimensions**: variables that do not vary within any\n",
    "  size band and define hard architectural constraints.\n",
    "- **Structurally invariant free dimensions**: variables that vary but contribute\n",
    "  constant degrees of freedom across size.\n",
    "- **Weakly size-sensitive dimensions**: variables whose degrees of freedom exhibit\n",
    "  limited, bounded variation across size bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "This classification will inform which dimensions should define configuration\n",
    "equivalence classes and which should be treated as admissible variation within\n",
    "classes. Establishing this distinction is necessary to ensure that equivalence\n",
    "classes reflect meaningful architectural similarity rather than superficial or\n",
    "catalog-level differences.\n"

    "## Phase 4: Structural Constraint Classification at Fixed Size\n",
    "\n",
    "This section classifies each admissible structural variable according to its\n",
    "behavior when system size is held fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this classification is to distinguish between:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Constrained dimensions**: variables that are effectively fixed once size\n",
    "  is conditioned and therefore do not meaningfully differentiate system\n",
    "  architectures at fixed size.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Free dimensions**: variables that vary independently across systems of\n",
    "  comparable size and therefore contribute to structural configuration diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conditional dimensions**: variables that are structurally meaningful only\n",
    "  for a subset of systems (e.g., dependent on the presence of a specific\n",
    "  architecture or valid measurement domain).\n",
    "\n",
    "This classification is empirical and descriptive. It is derived from observed\n",
    "variation within size bands and does not imply causality, performance, or\n",
    "optimality.\n",
    "\n",
