    "# Notebook 2 — Structural Degrees of Freedom at Fixed Size\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook evaluates **structural degrees of freedom (DoF) conditional on system size**\n",
    "for residential photovoltaic installations and defines **configuration equivalence classes**\n",
    "at fixed size.\n",
    "\n",
    "It consumes the system-level structural configuration artifact produced upstream,\n",
    "which enforces one row per `tts_link_id` and excludes sentinel identifiers prior to merge.\n",
    "All configuration families represented here correspond to realized, valid system identities.\n",
    "\n",
    "System size is treated as **fixed by analysis**, not as a configuration dimension.\n",
    "Conditioning is performed using cohort-relative size indices and size bands to ensure\n",
    "comparability across systems of similar scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objectives of this notebook are threefold:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify structural degrees of freedom at fixed size** by empirically determining\n",
    "   which architectural and functional configuration dimensions vary independently when\n",
    "   system size is held fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Derive structural constraints** by identifying dimensions that become effectively\n",
    "   fixed or degenerate within size bands, yielding a structural constraint specification\n",
    "   suitable for downstream analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Define configuration equivalence classes** by grouping systems that are structurally\n",
    "   identical at fixed size, equating them on constrained dimensions while ignoring\n",
    "   dimensions that vary freely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structural degrees of freedom are computed **at the variable level**, within size bands.\n",
    "Each variable contributes degrees of freedom according to its admissible value structure\n",
    "(binary, discrete, or ratio-based), evaluated only where that variable is structurally\n",
    "defined and physically meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook outputs the following artifacts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Structural constraints** (`structural_constraints.parquet`), encoding which\n",
    "  configuration dimensions are constrained or free at fixed size.\n",
    "- **Configuration equivalence classes** (`configuration_classes.parquet`), assigning\n",
    "  systems to structurally equivalent realizations at fixed size.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook does not infer regimes, evaluate deviation surfaces, or assign risk.\n",
    "Its role is strictly descriptive and structural, providing the dimensional and equivalence\n",
    "substrate required for downstream scaling, regime geometry, and deviation analysis.\n",
