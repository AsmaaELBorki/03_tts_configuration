    "# Notebook 2: Fixed-Size Conditioning for Structural Degrees of Freedom\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook performs **analytic size conditioning** in preparation for computing structural degrees of freedom in photovoltaic system configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "It consumes system-level structural context and configuration representations produced upstream in **Repo 3, Notebook 1**, where the admissible configuration state space was constructed without conditioning or inference. Here, system size is explicitly treated as **fixed by analysis**, rather than as a configuration dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to:\n",
    "- Define and validate size-based conditioning primitives\n",
    "- Construct size indices and size bands suitable for stratified analysis\n",
    "- Diagnose size variability and boundary behavior within and across bands\n",
    "- Establish the analytic framework required to evaluate structural degrees of freedom at fixed size\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook does **not** compute structural degrees of freedom, define regimes, assess deviation surfaces, or assign risk. Its role is strictly to prepare the conditioned analytical substrate on which such computations can be performed consistently and comparably in subsequent stages.\n"
