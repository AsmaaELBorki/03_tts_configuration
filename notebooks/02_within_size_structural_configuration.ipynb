    "\n",
    "Among systems with an explicitly reported manufacturer:\n",
    "- a small number of manufacturers (e.g., Tesla, LG, Enphase) dominate\n",
    "- the ordering of manufacturers is consistent across size bands\n",
    "- no meaningful enrichment or depletion is observed by size closeness\n",
    "\n",
    "These patterns indicate that:\n",
    "- battery manufacturer data reflect **reporting heterogeneity**, not structural\n",

    "- battery-related categorical variables do not define a primary within-size\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook examined whether residential solar systems exhibit meaningful\n",
    "**within-size structural variation** once expected system size is treated as the\n",
    "reference frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected system size—derived upstream—was held fixed in relative terms by\n",
    "grouping systems according to their deviation from expectation. Configuration\n",
    "attributes were then evaluated to determine whether systems that are close to,\n",
    "or moderately deviant from, expectation differ in systematic ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Across all configuration classes examined:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Indicator variables**\n",
    "- Most binary features (e.g., tracking, ground-mounted systems, ownership model,\n",
    "  DC optimizers) exhibit stable prevalence across size bands.\n",
    "- Limited differentiation is observed for new construction and expansion-related\n",
    "  attributes, indicating modest design flexibility rather than structural\n",
    "  divergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Categorical variables**\n",
    "- Technology type, installer identity, utility service territory, and city-level\n",
    "  geography show highly stable composition across size bands.\n",
    "- No categorical dimension exhibits meaningful enrichment or depletion as systems\n",
    "  move toward or away from tight size conformity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numeric variables**\n",
    "- Inverter loading ratio—the strongest numeric candidate—shows near-identical\n",
    "  medians, dispersion, and tail behavior across size bands.\n",
    "- Other numeric configuration fields are either sparsely reported or reflect\n",
    "  reporting structure rather than substantive design variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Structural Result\n",
    "\n",
    "Once expected system size is accounted for, residential solar systems in\n",
    "California exhibit **strong structural convergence**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Configuration choices, component practices, installer identity, and geography do\n",
    "not explain residual variation near the expected size surface. Deviations from\n",
    "expected size therefore cannot be attributed to unmodeled configuration mix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analytical Implication\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook establishes that **expected system size functions as a sufficient\n",
    "organizing principle** for residential solar installations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within-size residual variation reflects true deviation from a validated market\n",
    "reference, rather than compensatory configuration behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result:\n",
    "- downstream scaling analysis may treat expected size as a stable reference\n",
    "  manifold\n",
    "- abnormality and risk evaluation are not confounded by configuration heterogeneity\n",
    "- remaining analytical leverage lies in scaling behavior and deviation geometry,\n",
    "  not within-size structure\n",
    "\n",
    "This concludes the within-size structural analysis for Repo 3.\n"
